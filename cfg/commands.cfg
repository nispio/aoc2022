!  IMPORTANT NOTE:  Editing this file directly is strongly discouraged!
!
!  It is recommended that any changes to the commands.cfg be made via the
!  the UPDATE command.  If you do edit this file by hand, remember the
!  following:
!
!  1.	All dictionary entries MUST be uppercase and in strict alphabetical
!  	order by command name.  Violating this rule will result in unusual
!	behavior which can be difficult to diagnose.
!
!  2.	Changes are not picked up automatically; you will have to do an
!  	XMPATH/REDO or an appropriate CONFIGURE command to bring the changes
!	into your in-memory dictionary.
!
!  See HELP CONFIGURE for complete details.
